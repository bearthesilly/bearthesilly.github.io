Welcome to csrookie's website! This is the personal website of csrookie, dedicating to share info, resource and experience.

I'm currently a student studying computer science in Shanghaitech University(上海科技大学), Sophomore. Because of the motto "stay fool, stay hungry", I name my github repository 'csrookie' for, literally, I'm still a rookie in the field of cs. 

## Introduction
Currently interested in computer vision(Point Cloud) and computer graphics(Neural Radiance Field). I am also a little bit interested into the interpretability in Deep Learning. 

I have just finished the internship in [4DVLab](https://4dvlab.github.io/index.html) on the work of AAAI 2025 (Aug 20th), proudly under the instruction and guidance of [Prof.Yuexin Ma](https://yuexinma.me/aboutme.html) and senior [Yiteng Xu](https://yiteng-xu.github.io/). And I am currently looking for the next internship.
