Welcome to csrookie's website! This is the personal website of csrookie, dedicating to share info, resource and experience.

I'm currently a student studying computer science in Shanghaitech University(上海科技大学), Junior. I name my github repository 'csrookie' for, literally, I'm still a rookie in the field of cs. 

I'm currently a GLOBE Computer Science student to UC Berkeley. 

## Introduction

My interests lie in multiple aspects, like computer vision, natural language processing and time series. I'm also a little bit interested into the interpretability of deep learning. 

I finished the internship in [4DVLab](https://4dvlab.github.io/index.html) in September, 2024, proudly under the instruction and guidance of [Prof.Yuexin Ma](https://yuexinma.me/aboutme.html) and senior [Yiteng Xu](https://yiteng-xu.github.io/). I finished the short internship in [VRVC](https://vic.shanghaitech.edu.cn/vrvc/en/) in November, 2024, proudly under the guidance of senior [Zhehao Shen](https://moqiyinlun.github.io/). Currently, with great honor, I am working with [Prof.Kewei Tu](https://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/tukw/) and [Prof.Kan Ren](https://sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/rk/list.htm).
