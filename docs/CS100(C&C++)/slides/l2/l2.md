# Variable declaration

## Type of a variable

Every variable in C has a type.

- The type is **fully deterministic** and **cannot be changed**.
- The type is **known even when the program is not run**.
  - $\Leftrightarrow$ The type is known at **compile-time**.
  - $\Leftrightarrow$ C is **statically-typed** ${}^{\textcolor{red}{1}}$. $\Leftrightarrow$ C has a **static type system**.
  - In contrast, Python is **dynamically-typed**.

---

## Statically-typed vs dynamically-typed

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;">
  <div>

Python: dynamically typed

```python
a = 42       # Type of a is int.
a = "hello"  # Type of a becomes str.
```

The type of a variable

- can be changed, and
- is not necessarily known until we run the program.

  </div>
  <div>

C: statically-typed

```c
int a = 42;  // Type of a is int.
a = "hello"; // Error! Types mismatch!
```

The type of a variable

- is explicitly written on declaration, and
- is known at compile-time, and
- cannot be changed.
  </div>
</div>

A type-related error in C is *(usually)* a **compile error**:
- It stops the compiler. The executable will not be generated.

---

## Declare a variable

To declare a variable, we need to specify its **type** and **name**.

```c
Type name;
```

Example:

```c
int x;    // Declares a variable named `x`, whose type is `int`.
double y; // Declares a variable named `y`, whose type is `double`.
```

We may declare multiple variables of a same type in one declaration statement, separated by `,`:

```c
int x, y; // Declares two variables `x` and `y`, both having type `int`.
```

---

## Declare a variable

A **variable declaration** can be placed

- inside a function, which declares a **local variable**, or
- outside of any functions, which declares a **global variable**.

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;">
  <div>

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int x, y; // global variables

int main(void) {
  scanf("%d%d", &x, &y);
  printf("%d\n", x + y);
}
```
  </div>
  <div>

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  // local variables in `main`
  int x, y;
  scanf("%d%d", &x, &y);
  printf("%d\n", x + y);
}
```
  </div>
</div>

---

## Local variables vs global variables

Which one do you prefer?

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;">
  <div>

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int x, y; // global variables

int main(void) {
  scanf("%d%d", &x, &y);
  printf("%d\n", x + y);
}
```
  </div>
  <div>

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  // local variables in `main`
  int x, y;
  scanf("%d%d", &x, &y);
  printf("%d\n", x + y);
}
```
  </div>
</div>

---

## What are these variables used for?

```c
#include <stdio.h>
// Other #includes

int x, y; // What are these two variables used for?

int moveSpaceShuttle(SpaceShuttle *shuttle, Coord to, Vehicle *by) {
  // 109 lines
}
int makePreparations(Environment *env, Task tasks[], Time time) {
  // 73 lines
}
LaunchResult launchSpaceShuttle(SpaceShuttle *shuttle, Task tasks[]) {
  // 35 lines
}
// Other 136 functions, 3325 lines in total
int main(void) {
  // 120 lines
}
```

---

## Readability matters

**[Best practice]** <u>Declare the variable when you first use it!</u>

- If the declaration and use of the variable are too separated, it will become much more difficult to figure out what they are used for as the program goes longer.

**[Best practice]** <u>Use meaningful names!</u>

- The program would be a mess if polluted with names like `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `x`, `y`, `cnt`, `cnt_2`, `flag1`, `flag2`, `flag3` everywhere.
- Use meaningful names: `sumOfScore`, `student_cnt`, `open_success`, ...

**Readability is very important.** Many students debug day and night simply because their programs are not human-readable.

---

## Use of global variables

One reason for using global variables is to have them shared between functions:

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;">
  <div>

```c
int input;
void work(void) {
  printf("%d\n", input);
}
int main(void) {
  scanf("%d", &input);
  work();
}
```
  </div>
  <div>

```c
void work(void) {
  // Error: `input` was not decared
  // in this scope.
  printf("%d\n", input);
}
int main(void) {
  int input;
  scanf("%d", &input);
  work();
}
```

  </div>
</div>

$\Rightarrow$ More about scopes and name lookup in later lectures / recitations.

---

## Initialize a variable

A variable can be **initialized** on declaration.

```c
int x = 42; // Declares the variable `x` of type `int`,
            // and initializes its value to 42.
int a = 0, b, c = 42; // Declares three `int` variables, with `a` initialized
                      // to 0, `c` initialized to 42, and `b` uninitialized.
```

This is syntactically **different** (though seems equivalent) to

```c
int x;  // Declares `x`, uninitialized.
x = 42; // Assigns 42 to `x`.
```

**[Best practice]** <u>Initialize the variable if possible. Prefer initialization to later assignment.</u>

$\Rightarrow$ More on initialization in later lectures.

Experiment:

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;">
  <div>

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int x = 1;
  while (1) {
    printf("%d\n", x);
    x *= 2; // x = x * 2
    getchar();
  }
}
```
  </div>
  <div>

- On 64-bit Ubuntu 22.04 and compiled with GCC 13, after printing `1073741824` ($2^{30}$), the output becomes negative, and then `0`.
  
  ```
  1073741824
  -2147483648

  ```
  </div>
</div>

## Bits and bytes

Information is stored in computers **in binary**.

- $42_{\text{ten}}=101010_{\text{two}}$.

A **bit** is either $0$ or $1$.

- The binary representation of $42$ consists of $6$ bits.

A **byte** is $8$ bits ${}^{\textcolor{red}{2}}$ grouped together like $10001001$.

- At least $1$ byte is needed to store $42$.
- At least $3$ bytes are needed to store $142857_{\text{ten}}=100010111000001001_{\text{two}}$

---

## Bits and bytes

A 32-bit number: $2979269462_{\text{ten}}=10110001100101000000101101010110_{\text{two}}$.

Suppose now we have $n$ bits.

- How many different values can be represented?
- What is the largest integer that can be represented?
- How do we represent negative numbers? Non-integer values? ...

---

## Bits and bytes

Suppose now we have $n$ bits.

- How many different values can be represented?
  - $2^n$.
- What is the largest integer that can be represented?
  - $2^n-1=\underbrace{111\dots 1}_{n}{}_{\text{two}}$.
- How do we represent negative numbers? Non-integer values? ...
  - There are several different [signed number representations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signed_number_representations), among which **two's complement** is widely used.
  - About floating-point numbers: [IEEE754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754)
  - Details are not covered in CS100.

---

## Integer types

An integer type in C is either **signed** or **unsigned**, and has a **width** denoting the number of bits that can be used to represent values.

Suppose we have an integer type of $n$ bits in width.

- If the type is **signed** ${}^{\textcolor{red}{3}}$, the range of values that can be represented is $\left[-2^{n-1},2^{n-1}-1\right]$.
- If the type is **unsigned**, the range of values that can be represented is $\left[0, 2^n-1\right]$.

---

## Integer types

<a align="center">
  <img src="img/int_types.png">
</a>

---

## Integer types

- The keyword `int` is optional in types other than `int`:
  - e.g. `short int` and `short` name the same type.
  - e.g. `unsigned int` and `unsigned` name the same type.

- "Unsigned-ness" needs to be written explicitly: `unsigned int`, `unsigned long`, ...
- Types without the keyword `unsigned` are signed by default:
  - e.g. `signed int` and `int` name the same type.
  - e.g. `signed long int`, `signed long`, `long int` and `long` name the same type.

---

## Width of integer types

<div align="center">

| type        | width (at least) | width (usually) |
| ----------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| `short`     | 16 bits          | 16 bits         |
| `int`       | 16 bits          | 32 bits         |
| `long`      | 32 bits          | 32 or 64 bits   |
| `long long` | 64 bits          | 64 bits         |
</div>

- A signed type has the same width as its `unsigned` counterpart.
- **It is also guaranteed that `sizeof(short)` $\leqslant$ `sizeof(int)` $\leqslant$ `sizeof(long)` $\leqslant$ `sizeof(long long)`.**
  - `sizeof(T)` is the number of **bytes** that `T` holds.

---

## Implementation-defined behaviors

The standard states that the exact width of the integer types is **implementation-defined**.

- **Implementation**: The compiler and the standard library.
- An implementation-defined behavior depends on the compiler and the standard library, and is often also related to the hosted environment (e.g. the operating system).

---

## Which one should I use?

**`int` is the most optimal integer type for the platform.**

- Use `int` for integer arithmetic by default.
- Use `long long` if the range of `int` is not large enough.
- Use smaller types (`short`, or even `unsigned char`) for memory-saving or other special purposes.
- Use `unsigned` types for special purposes. We will see some in later lectures.

---

## Which one is the real world, the integer types or $\mathbb Z$?

<a align="center">
  <img src="img/int_types_arrows.png", width=600>
</a>

---

## Real floating types

"Floating-point": The number's radix point can "float" anywhere to the left, right, or between the significant digits of the number.

Real floating-point types can be used to represent *some* real values.

- Real floating-point types $\neq\mathbb R$.

---

## Real floating types

C has three types for representing real floating-point values:

- `float`: single precision. Matches [IEEE754 binary32 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-precision_floating-point_format) if supported.
- `double`: double precision. Matches [IEEE754 binary64 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format) if supported.
- `long double`: extended precision. A floating-point type whose precision and range are at least as good as those of `double`.

Details of IEEE754 formats are not required in CS100.

Range of values can be found in [this table](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/arithmetic_types#Range_of_values).

---

## Which one should I use?

Use `double` for real floating-point arithmetic by default.

- In some cases the precision of `float` is not enough.
- Don't worry about efficiency! `double` arithmetic is not necessarily slower than `float`.

**Do not use floating-point types for integer arithmetic!**

---

## `scanf`/`printf`

Refer to the table in [this page](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/io/fscanf).

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;">
  <div align="center">

| type        | format specifier |
| ----------- | ---------------- |
| `short`     | `%hd`            |
| `int`       | `%d`             |
| `long`      | `%ld`            |
| `long long` | `%lld`           |
  </div>
  <div align="center">

| type                 | format specifier |
| -------------------- | ---------------- |
| `unsigned short`     | `%hu`            |
| `unsigned`           | `%u`             |
| `unsigned long`      | `%lu`            |
| `unsigned long long` | `%llu`           |
  </div>
</div>

- `%f` for `float`, `%lf` for `double`, and `%Lf` for `long double`.

---

## Exercise

Write the "A+B" program for real numbers. Which type do you decide to use? How do you read and print the values?

}
```

---

## Character types

The C standard provides three **different** character types: `signed char`, `unsigned char` and `char`.

Let `T` $\in\{$`signed char`, `unsigned char`, `char`$\}$. It is guaranteed that

`1 == sizeof(T) <= sizeof(short) <= sizeof(int) <= sizeof(long) <= sizeof(long long)`.
- **`T` takes exactly 1 byte**.

Question: What is the valid range of `signed char`? `unsigned char`?

---

## Character types

Question: What is the valid range of `signed char`? `unsigned char`?

- `signed char`: $[-128, 127]$.
- `unsigned char`: $[0, 255]$.

What? A character is an integer?

---

## ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)

A character is represented in computers as its [ASCII code](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/ascii), which is a small integer.

</a>

---

## ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)

A character is represented in computers as its [ASCII code](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/ascii), which is a small integer.

- We only consider the so-called *ASCII characters* here.

<a align="center">
  <img src="img/ascii_char.png">
</a>

A character is **nothing but** an integer! In C, there is no "conversion" between characters and ASCII code!

---

## ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)

Important things to remember:

- $[$`'0'`$,$`'9'`$]=[48, 57]$.
- $[$`'A'`$,$`'Z'`$]=[65, 90]$.
- $[$`'a'`$,$`'z'`$]=[97, 122]$.

Example: Given a lowercase letter, return its uppercase form.

```c
char to_uppercase(char x) {
  return x - 32;
}
```

---

## [Best practice] <u>Avoid magic numbers</u>

What is the meaning of `32` here? $\Rightarrow$ a magic number.

```c
char to_uppercase(char x) {
  return x - 32;
}
```

Write it in a more human-readable way:

```c
char to_uppercase(char x) {
  return x - ('a' - 'A');
}
```

---

## Escape sequence

Some special characters are not directly representable: newline, tab, quote, ...

We use [escape sequences](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/escape), e.g.

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;">
  <div align="center">

| escape sequence | description  |
| --------------- | ------------ |
| `\'`            | single quote |
| `\"`            | double quote |
| `\\`            | backslash    |
  </div>
  <div align="center">

| escape sequence | description     |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| `\n`            | newline         |
| `\r`            | carriage return |
| `\t`            | horizontal tab  |
  </div>
</div>

---

## Character types

`char`, `signed char` and `unsigned char` are **three different types**.

- Whether `char` is signed or unsigned is **implementation-defined**.
- If `char` is signed (unsigned), it represents the same set of values as the type `signed char` (`unsigned char`), but **they are not the same type**.
  - In contrast, `T` and `signed T` are the same type for `T` $\in\{$`short`, `int`, `long`, `long long`$\}$.

---

## Character types

For almost all cases, use `char` (or, sometimes `int`) to represent characters.

`signed char` and `unsigned char` are used for other purposes.

To read/print a `char` using `scanf`/`printf`, use `%c`.

## Sad story: Handling non-ASCII characters? ...

<a align="center">

---

## Sad story: Handling non-ASCII characters? ...

Even though the standard provides `wchar_t`, `char8_t` (since C23), `char16_t` and `char32_t` to handle wide/Unicode characters, there are still a lot of problems.

C++23 has some improvement.

## Boolean type: `bool` (since C99)

A type that represents true/false, 0/1, yes/no, ...

To access the name `bool`, `true` and `false`, `<stdbool.h>` is needed. (until C23)

Example: Define a function that accepts a character and returns whether that character is a lowercase letter.

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;">
  <div>

Before C99, using `int`, `0` and `1`:

```c
int is_lowercase(char c) {
  if (c >= 'a' && c <= 'z')
    return 1;
  else
    return 0;
}
```
  </div>
  <div>

Since C99, using `bool`, `false` and `true`:

```c
bool is_lowercase(char c) {
  if (c >= 'a' && c <= 'z')
    return true;
  else
    return false;
}
```
  </div>
</div>

---

## Boolean type: `bool` (since C99)

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;">
  <div>

Before C99, using `int`, `0` and `1`:

```c
int is_lowercase(char c) {
  if (c >= 'a' && c <= 'z')
    return 1;
  else
    return 0;
}
```
  </div>
  <div>

Since C99, using `bool`, `false` and `true`:

```c
bool is_lowercase(char c) {
  if (c >= 'a' && c <= 'z')
    return true;
  else
    return false;
}
```
  </div>
</div>

Both return values can be used as follows:

```c
char c; scanf("%c", &c);
if (is_lowercase(c)) {
  // do something when c is lowercase ...
}
```

---

## [Best practice] <u>Simplify your code</u>

Just return the result of the condition expression.

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;">
  <div>

```c
int is_lowercase(char c) {
  return c >= 'a' && c <= 'z';
}
```
  </div>
  <div>

```c
bool is_lowercase(char c) {
  return c >= 'a' && c <= 'z';
}
```
  </div>
</div>

We will introduce the operators (`&&`, `<=`, `>=`) involved here in later lectures.

```c
if (op == '+') {
  // ...
} else if (op == '-') {
  // ...
} else if (op == '*') {
  // ...
} else if (op == '/') {
  // ...
} else {
  // report an error
}
```

## Notes

${}^{\textcolor{red}{1}}$ The type of every expression in C is determined at compile-time except for *variable-length arrays* (since C99).

${}^{\textcolor{red}{2}}$ A byte is 8 bits on most platforms, but we do have exceptions: [36-bit computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/36-bit_computing).

${}^{\textcolor{red}{3}}$ There are several different signed number representations, but all popular machines and almost all compilers use **two's complement**. Before C23 and C++20, the C/C++ standards allow for all possible representations, so the minimal valid range for a $n$-bit integer is $\left[-2^{n-1}+1,2^{n-1}-1\right]$, which is the range for *one's complement* and *sign-and-magnitude*. Since C23 and C++20, the only representation allowed is two's complement, so the valid range is guaranteed to be $\left[-2^{n-1},2^{n-1}-1\right]$. In CS100 we still assume that two's complement is used, even though we are based on C17/C++17.
