# `struct`

## `struct` type

The name of the type defined by a `struct` is `struct Name`.

- Unlike C++, the keyword `struct` here is necessary.

```c
struct Student stu; // `stu` is an object of type `struct Student`
struct Point3d polygon[1000]; // `polygon` is an array of 1000 objects,
                              // each being of type `struct Point3d`.
struct TreeNode *pNode; // `pNode` is a pointer to `struct TreeNode`.
```

**\* The term "*object*" is used interchangeably with "*variable*".**

- *Objects* often refer to variables of `struct` (or `class` in C++) types.
- But in fact, there's nothing wrong to say "an `int` object".

---

## Members of a `struct`

Use `obj.mem`, the **member-access operator `.`** to access a member.

```c
struct Student stu;
stu.name = "Alice";
stu.id = "2024533000";
stu.entrance_year = 2024;
stu.dorm = 8;
printf("%d\n", student.dorm);
++student.entrance_year;
puts(student.name);
```

## Dynamic allocation

Create an object of `struct` type dynamically: Just allocate `sizeof(struct Student)` bytes of memory.

```c
struct Student *pStu = malloc(sizeof(struct Student));
```

Member access through a pointer: `ptr->mem`, or `(*ptr).mem` **(not `*ptr.mem`!).**

```c
pStu->name = "Alice";
pStu->id = "2024533000";
(*pStu).entrance_year = 2024; // equivalent to pStu->entrance_year = 2024;
printf("%d\n", pStu->entrance_year);
puts(pStu->name);
```

As usual, don't forget to `free` after use.

```c
free(pStu);
```

## Size of a `struct`

```c
struct Student {
  const char *name;
  const char *id;
  int entrance_year;
  int dorm;
};
```

```c
struct Student *pStu = malloc(sizeof(struct Student));
```

What is the value of `sizeof(struct Student)`?

## Size of `struct`

It is guaranteed that

$$
\mathtt{sizeof(struct\ \ X)}\geqslant\sum_{\mathtt{member}\in\mathtt{X}}\mathtt{sizeof(member)}.
$$

The inequality is due to **memory alignment requirements**, which is beyond the scope of CS100.

## Implicit initialization

What happens if an object of `struct` type is not explicitly initialized?

```c
struct Student gStu;

int main(void) {
  struct Student stu;
}
```

---

## Implicit initialization

What happens if an object of `struct` type is not explicitly initialized?

```c
struct Student gStu;

int main(void) {
  struct Student stu;
}
```

- Global or local `static`: "empty-initialization", which performs **member-wise** empty-initialization.
- Local non-`static`: every member is initialized to indeterminate values (in other words, uninitialized).

---

## Explicit initialization

Use an initializer list:

```c
struct Student stu = {"Alice", "2024533000", 2024, 8};
```

**Use C99 designators:** (highly recommended)

```c
struct Student stu = {.name = "Alice", .id = "2024533000",
                      .entrance_year = 2024, .dorm = 8};
```

The designators greatly improve the readability.

**[Best practice]** <u>Use designators, especially for `struct` types with lots of members.</u>

---

## Compound literals

```c
struct Student *student_list = malloc(sizeof(struct Student) * n);
for (int i = 0; i != n; ++i) {
  student_list[i].name = A(i); // A, B, C and D are some functions
  student_list[i].id = B(i);
  student_list[i].entrance_year = C(i);
  student_list[i].dorm = D(i);
}
```

Use a **compound literal** to make it clear and simple:

```c
struct Student *student_list = malloc(sizeof(struct Student) * n);
for (int i = 0; i != n; ++i) {
  student_list[i] = (struct Student){.name = A(i), .id = B(i),
                                     .entrance_year = C(i), .dorm = D(i)};
}

```

---

## `struct`-typed parameters

The semantic of argument passing is **copy**:

```c
void print_student(struct Student s) {
  printf("Name: %s, ID: %s, dorm: %d\n", s.name, s.id, s.dorm);
}

print_student(student_list[i]);
```

In a call `print_student(student_list[i])`, the parameter `s` of `print_student` is initialized as follows:

```c
struct Student s = student_list[i];
```

The copy of a `struct`-typed object: **Member-wise copy.**

---

## `struct`-typed parameters

In a call `print_student(student_list[i])`, the parameter `s` of `print_student` is initialized as follows:

```c
struct Student s = student_list[i];
```

The copy of a `struct`-typed object: **Member-wise copy.** It is performed as if

```c
s.name = student_list[i].name;
s.id = student_list[i].id;
s.entrance_year = student_list[i].entrance_year;
s.dorm = student_list[i].dorm;
```

---

## Return a `struct`-typed object

Strictly speaking, returning is also a **copy**:

```c
struct Student fun(void) {
  struct Student s = something();
  some_operations(s);
  return s;
}
student_list[i] = fun();
```

The object `s` is returned as if

```c
student_list[i] = s;
```

**But in fact, the compiler is more than willing to optimize this process.** We will talk more about this in C++.

---

## Array member

```c
struct A {
  int array[10];
  // ...
};
```

Although an array cannot be copied, **an array member can be copied**.

The copy of an array is **element-wise copy**.


```c
int a[10];
int b[10] = a; // Error!
```

```c
struct A a;
struct A b = a; // OK
```
---

## Summary

A `struct` is a type consisting of a sequence of members.

- Member access: `obj.mem`, `ptr->mem` (equivalent to `(*ptr).mem`, but better)
- `sizeof(struct A)`, no less than the sum of size of every member.
  
  - But not necessarily equal, due to memory alignment requirements.
- Implicit initialization: recursively performed on every member.
- Initializer-lists, designators, compound literals.
- Copy of a `struct`: member-wise copy.
- Argument passing and returning: copy.

# Recursion

## Problem 1. Calculate $n!$

```c
int factorial(int n) {
  return n == 0 ? 1 : n * factorial(n - 1);
}
```

**This is perfectly valid and reasonable C code!**

- The function `factorial` **recursively** calls itself.Problem 2. Print a non-negative integer

If we only have `getchar`, how can we read an integer?

- We have solved this in recitations.

If we only have `putchar`, how can we print an integer?

- Declared in `<stdio.h>`.
- `putchar(c)` prints a character `c`. That's it.

For convenience, suppose the integer is non-negative (unsigned).

## Print a non-negative integer

To print $x$:

- If $x < 10$, just print the digit and we are done.
- Otherwise ($x\geqslant 10$), we first print $\displaystyle\left\lfloor\frac{x}{10}\right\rfloor$, and then print the digit on the last place.

```c
void print(unsigned x) {
  if (x < 10)
    putchar(x + '0'); // Remember ASCII?
  else {
    print(x / 10);
    putchar(x % 10 + '0');
  }
}
```

---

## Simplify the code

To print $x$:

1. If $x\geqslant 10$, we first print $\displaystyle\left\lfloor\frac{x}{10}\right\rfloor$. Otherwise, do nothing.
2. Print $x\bmod 10$.

```c
void print(unsigned x) {
  if (x >= 10)
    print(x / 10);
  putchar(x % 10 + '0');
}
```

## Design a recursive algorithm

Suppose we are given a problem of scale $n$.

1. Divide the problem into one or more **subproblems**, which are of smaller scales.
2. Solve the subproblems **recursively** by calling the function itself.
3. Generate the answer to the big problem from the answers to the subproblems.

**\* Feels like mathematical induction?**

## Problem 3. Selection-sort

How do you sort a sequence of $n$ numbers? (In ascending order)

Do it **recursively**.



How do you sort a sequence of $n$ numbers $\langle a_0,\cdots,a_{n-1}\rangle$? (In ascending order)

Do it **recursively**: Suppose we are going to sort $\langle a_k,a_{k+1},\cdots,a_{n-1}\rangle$, for some $k$.

- If $k=n-1$, we are done.
- Otherwise ($k<n-1$):
  1. Find the minimal number $a_m=\min\left\{a_k,a_{k+1},\cdots,a_{n-1}\right\}$.
  2. Put $a_m$ at the first place by swapping it with $a_k$.
  3. Now $a_k$ is the smallest number in $\langle a_k,\cdots,a_{n-1}\rangle$. All we have to do is to sort the rest part $\langle a_{k+1},\cdots,a_{n-1}\rangle$ **recursively**.

```c
void sort_impl(int *a, int k, int n) {
  if (k == n - 1) return;
  
  int m = k;
  for (int i = k + 1; i < n; ++i)
    if (a[i] < a[m]) m = i;
  
  swap(&a[m], &a[k]); // the "swap" function we defined in previous lectures
  
  sort_impl(a, k + 1, n); // sort the rest part recursively
}
```
