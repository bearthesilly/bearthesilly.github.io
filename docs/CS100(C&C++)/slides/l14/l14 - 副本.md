# Members of a class

---

## A simple `class` 

The initial idea: A `class` is a new kind of `struct` that can have member functions:

```cpp
class Student {
  std::string name; 
  std::string id;
  int entranceYear;
  void setName(const std::string &newName) {
    name = newName;
  }
  void printInfo() const {
    std::cout << "I am " << name << ", id " << id  
              << ", entrance year: " << entranceYear << std::endl;
  }
  bool graduated(int year) const {
    return year - entranceYear >= 4; 
  }
};
```

---

## Member access

Member access: `a.mem`, where `a` is an **object** of the class type.

- Every member ${}^{\textcolor{red}{1}}$ belongs to an object: each student has a name, id, entrance year, etc.
  - You need to specify *whose* name / id / ... you want to obtain.

To call a member function on an object: `a.memfun(args)`.

```cpp
Student s = someValue();
s.printInfo(); // call its printInfo() to print related info  
if (s.graduated(2023)) {
  // ...
}
```

---

## Access control

```cpp
class Student {
private:
  std::string name; 
  std::string id;
  int entranceYear;
public:
  void setName(const std::string &newName) { name = newName; }
  void printInfo() const {
    std::cout << "I am " << name << ", id " << id  
              << ", entrance year: " << entranceYear << std::endl;
  }
  bool graduated(int year) const { return year - entranceYear >= 4; }
};
```

- `private` members: Only accessible to code inside the class and `friend`s.
  - $\Rightarrow$ We will introduce `friend`s in later lectures.
- `public` members: Accessible to all parts of the program.

---

## Access control 

```cpp  
class Student {
private:
  std::string name;
  std::string id; 
  int entranceYear;

public:
  void setName(const std::string &newName);
  void printInfo() const;
  bool graduated(int year) const;  
};
```

Unlike some other languages (e.g. Java), an access specifier controls the access of all members after it, until the next access specifier or the end of the class definition.

---

## Access control 

```cpp  
class Student {
// private:
  std::string name;
  std::string id; 
  int entranceYear;
public:
  void setName(const std::string &newName);
  void printInfo() const;
  bool graduated(int year) const;  
};
```

What if there is a group of members with no access specifier at the beginning?
- If it's `class`, they are `private`.  
- If it's `struct`, they are `public`.

This is one of the **only two differences** between `struct` and `class` in C++.

---

## The `this` pointer

```cpp
class Student {
  // ...  
public:
  bool graduated(int year) const;
};

Student s = someValue();
if (s.graduated(2023))
  // ...
```

How many parameters does `graduated` have?

---

## The `this` pointer

```cpp
class Student {
  // ...
public:
  bool graduated(int year) const; 
};

Student s = someValue();
if (s.graduated(2023)) // ...
```

How many parameters does `graduated` have?

- **Seemingly one, but actually two:** `s` is also information that must be known when calling this function!

---

## The `this` pointer

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 0.9fr 1fr;">
  <div>

```cpp
class Student {
public:
  void setName(const std::string &n) {
    name = n;
  }

  bool graduated(int year) const {
    return year - entranceYear >= 4;
  }  
};

Student s = someValue();
if (s.graduated(2023)) 
  // ...
s.setName("Alice");
```

  </div>
  
  <div>

- The code on the left can be viewed as:
  
```cpp
void setName
    (Student *this, const std::string &n) {
  this->name = n;
}
bool graduated
    (const Student *this, int year) {
  return year - this->entranceYear >= 4;
}

Student s = someValue();
if (graduated(&s, 2023))
  // ...  
setName(&s, "Alice");
```

  </div>
</div>

---

## The `this` pointer

There is a pointer called `this` in each member function of class `X` which has type `X *` or `const X *`, pointing to the object on which the member function is called.

Inside a member function, access of any member `mem` is actually `this->mem`.

We can also write `this->mem` explicitly.

```cpp
class Student {
public:
  bool graduated(int year) const {
    return year - this->entranceYear >= 4;
  }
};
```

Many languages have similar constructs, e.g. `self` in Python. [(C++23 has `self` too!)](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/member_functions#Explicit_object_parameter)

---

## `const` member functions

The `const` keyword after the parameter list and before the function body `{` is used to declare a **`const` member function**.
- A `const` member function cannot modify its data members ${}^{\textcolor{red}{2}}$.
- A `const` member function **guarantees** that no data member will be modified.
  - A non-`const` member function does not provide such guarantee.
  - In a `const` member function, calling a non-`const` member function on `*this` is not allowed.
- For a `const` object, **only `const` member functions can be called on it**.

**[Best practice]** <u>If, logically, a member function should not modify the object's state, it should be made a `const` member function.</u> Otherwise, it cannot be called on `const` objects.

---

## `const` member functions and the `this` pointer

This `const` is essentially applied to the `this` pointer:
- In `const` member functions of class `X`, `this` has type `const X *`.
- In non-`const` member functions of class `X`, `this` has type `X *`.

If `ptr` is of type `const T *`, the expression `ptr->mem` is also `const`-qualified.
- Recall that in a member function, access of a member `mem` is actually `this->mem`.
- Therefore, `mem` is also `const`-qualified in a `const` member function.

```cpp
class Student {
public:
  void foo() const {
    name += 'a'; // Error: `name` is `const std::string` in a const member
                 // function. It cannot be modified.
  }
};
```

---

## `const` member functions

*Effective C++* Item 3: **Use `const` whenever possible.**

Decide whether the following member functions need a `const` qualification:

```cpp
class Student {
  std::string name, id;
  int entranceYear;
public:
  const std::string &getName(); // returns the name of the student.
  const std::string &getID();   // returns the id of the student.
  bool valid();    // verifies whether the leading four digits in `id`
                   // is equal to `entranceYear`.
  void adjustID(); // adjust `id` according to `entranceYear`.
};
```

---

## `const` member functions

*Effective C++* Item 3: **Use `const` whenever possible.**

Decide whether the following member functions need a `const` qualification:

```cpp
class Student {
  std::string name, id;
  int entranceYear;
public:
  const std::string &getName() const; // returns the name of the student.
  const std::string &getID() const;   // returns the id of the student.
  bool valid() const;    // verifies whether the leading four digits in `id`
                         // is equal to `entranceYear`.
  void adjustID(); // adjust `id` according to `entranceYear`.
};
```

The `const`ness of member functions should be determined **logically**.

---

## `const` member functions

```cpp
class Student {
  std::string name, id;
  int entranceYear;
public:
  const std::string &getName() const { return name; }
  const std::string &getID() const { return id; }
  bool valid() const { return id.substr(0, 4) == std::to_string(entranceYear); }
  void adjustID() { id = std::to_string(entranceYear) + id.substr(4); }
};
```

`str.substr(pos, len)` returns the substring of `str` starting from the position indexed `pos` with length `len`.

- If `len` is not provided, it returns the **suffix** starting from the position indexed `pos`.

---

# Constructors

Often abbreviated as "ctors".

---

## Constructors

**Constructors** define how an object can be initialized.

- Constructors are often **overloaded**, because an object may have multiple reasonable ways of initialization.

```cpp
class Student {
  std::string name;
  std::string id;
  int entranceYear;
public:
  Student(const std::string &name_, const std::string &id_, int ey) 
    : name(name_), id(id_), entranceYear(ey) {}
  Student(const std::string &name_, const std::string &id_)
    : name(name_), id(id_), entranceYear(std::stoi(id_.substr(0, 4))) {}   
};

Student a("Alice", "2020123123", 2020);
Student b("Bob", "2020123124"); // entranceYear = 2020
Student c; // Error: No default constructor. (to be discussed later)
```

---

## Constructors

```cpp 
class Student {
  std::string name;
  std::string id;
  int entranceYear;

public:
  Student(const std::string &name_, const std::string &id_) 
    : name(name_), id(id_), entranceYear(std::stoi(id_.substr(0, 4))) {}
};
```

- The constructor name is the class name: `Student`.
- Constructors do not have a return type (not even `void` ${}^{\textcolor{red}{3}}$). The constructor body can contain a `return;` statement, which should not return a value.
- The function body of this constructor is empty: `{}`.

---

## Constructor initializer list

Constructors initialize **all data members** of the object.

The initialization of **all data members** is done **before entering the function body**.

How they are initialized is (partly) determined by the **constructor initializer list**:

```cpp
class Student {
  // ...
public:
  Student(const std::string &name_, const std::string &id_) 
    : name(name_), id(id_), entranceYear(std::stoi(id_.substr(0, 4))) {} 
};
```

The initializer list starts with `:`, and contains initializers for each data member, separated by `,`. The initializers must be of the form `(...)` or `{...}`, not `= ...`.

---

## Order of initialization

Data members are initialized in order **in which they are declared**, not the order in the initializer list.
- If the initializers appear in an order different from the declaration order, the compiler will generate a warning.

Typical mistake: `entranceYear` is initialized in terms of `id`, but `id` is not initialized yet!

```cpp
class Student {
  std::string name;
  int entranceYear; // !!!
  std::string id;

public:
  Student(const std::string &name_, const std::string &id_)
    : name(name_), id(id_), entranceYear(std::stoi(id.substr(0, 4))) {}
};
```

---

## Constructor initializer list

Data members are initialized in order **in which they are declared**, not the order in the initializer list.
- If the initializers appear in an order different from the declaration order, the compiler will generate a warning.  
- For a data member that do not appear in the initializer list:
  - If there is an **in-class initializer** (see next page), it is initialized using the in-class initializer.
  - Otherwise, it is **default-initialized**.

What does **default-initialization** mean for class types? $\Rightarrow$ To be discussed later.

---

## In-class initializers

A member can have an in-class initializer. It must be in the form `{...}` or `= ...`.${}^{\textcolor{red}{4}}$

```cpp
class Student {
  std::string name = "Alice";
  std::string id;
  int entranceYear{2024}; // equivalent to `int entranceYear = 2024;`.
public:
  Student() {} // `name` is initialized to `"Alice"`,
               // `id` is initialized to an empty string,
               // and `entranceYear` is initialized to 2024.
  Student(int ey) : entranceYear(ey) {} // `name` is initialized to `"Alice"`,
                                    // `id` is initialized to an empty string,
                                    // and `entranceYear` is initialized to `ey`.
};
```

The in-class initializer provides the "default" way of initializing a member in this class, as a substitute for default-initialization.

---

## Constructor initializer list

Below is a typical way of writing this constructor without an initializer list:

```cpp
class Student {
  // ...
public:
  Student(const std::string &name_, const std::string &id_) {
    name = name_;
    id = id_;
    entranceYear = std::stoi(id_.substr(0, 4));
  }
}; 
```

How are these members actually initialized in this constructor?

---

## Constructor initializer list

Below is a typical way of writing this constructor without an initializer list:

```cpp
class Student {
  // ...
public:
  Student(const std::string &name_, const std::string &id_) {
    name = name_;
    id = id_;
    entranceYear = std::stoi(id_.substr(0, 4));
  }
}; 
```

How are these members actually initialized in this constructor?

- First, before entering the function body, `name`, `id` and `entranceYear` are default-initialized. `name` and `id` are initialized to empty strings.
- Then, the assignments in the function body take place.

---

## Constructor initializer list

**[Best practice]** <u>Always use an initializer list in a constructor.</u>
- Not all types can be default-initialized. Not all types can be assigned to. (Any counterexamples?)

---

## Constructor initializer list

**[Best practice]** <u>Always use an initializer list in a constructor.</u>

Not all types can be default-initialized. Not all types can be assigned to.
- References `T &` cannot be default-initialized, and cannot be assigned to.
- `const` objects of built-in types cannot be default-initialized.
- `const` objects cannot be assigned to.
- A class can choose to allow or disallow default initialization or assignment. It depends on the design. $\Rightarrow$ See next page.

Moreover, if a data member is default-initialized and then assigned when could have been initialized directly, it may lead to low efficiency.

---

## Default constructors

A special constructor that takes no parameters.
- Guess what it's for?

---

## Default Constructors
  
A special constructor that takes no parameters.
- It defines the behavior of **default-initialization** of objects of that class type, since no arguments need to be passed when calling it.

```cpp
class Point2d {
  double x, y;
public:
  Point2d() : x(0), y(0) {} // default constructor
  Point2d(double x_, double y_) : x(x_), y(y_) {}  
};

Point2d p1;       // calls default ctor, (0, 0) 
Point2d p2(3, 4); // calls Point2d(double, double), (3, 4)
Point2d p3();     // Is this calling the default ctor?
```

---

## Default constructors
  
A special constructor that takes no parameters.
- It defines the behavior of **default-initialization** of objects of that class type, since no arguments need to be passed when calling it.

```cpp
class Point2d {
  double x, y;
public:
  Point2d() : x(0), y(0) {} // default constructor
  Point2d(double x_, double y_) : x(x_), y(y_) {}  
};

Point2d p1;       // calls default ctor, (0, 0) 
Point2d p2(3, 4); // calls Point2d(double, double), (3, 4)
Point2d p3();     // Is this calling the default ctor?
```

Be careful! `p3` is a **function** that takes no parameters and returns `Point2d`.

---

## Is a default constructor needed?

First, if you need to use arrays, you almost certainly need a default constructor:

```cpp
Student s[1000]; // All elements are default-initialized
                 // by the default constructor.
Student s2[1000] = {a, b}; // The first two elements are initialized to
                           // `a` and `b`. The rest are initialized by the
                           // default constructor.
```

A `std::vector` does not require that:

```cpp
// In this code, the default constructor of `Student` is not called.
std::vector<Student> students;
for (auto i = 0; i != n; ++i)
  students.push_back(some_student());
```

---

## Is a default constructor needed? 

If a class has no user-declared constructors, the compiler will try to synthesize a default constructor.

```cpp 
class X {}; // No user-declared constructors.
X x; // OK: calls the compiler-synthesized default constructor
```

The synthesized default constructor initializes the data members as follows:
- If a data member has an in-class initializer, it is initialized according to the in-class initializer.
- Otherwise, default-initialize that member. If it cannot be default-initialized, the compiler will give up -- no default constructor is generated.

---

## Is a default constructor needed?

If a class has any user-declared constructors but no default constructor, the compiler **will not** synthesize a default constructor.

You may ask for a default constructor with `= default;`:

```cpp
class Student {
public:
  Student(const std::string &name_, const std::string &id_, int ey)  
    : name(name_), id(id_), entranceYear(ey) {}
  
  Student(const std::string &name_, const std::string &id_)
    : name(name_), id(id_), entranceYear(std::stoi(id_.substr(0, 4))) {}
    
  Student() = default;
};
```

---

## Is a default constructor needed?

It depends on the **design**:
- If the class has a default constructor, what should be the behavior of it? Is there a reasonable "default state" for your class type?

For `Student`: What is a "default student"?

---

## Is a default constructor needed?

It depends on the **design**:
- If the class has a default constructor, what should be the behavior of it? Is there a reasonable "default state" for your class type?

For `Student`: What is a "default student"?
- There seems to be no such thing as a "default student" (in a normal design). Therefore, `Student` should not have a default constructor.

---

## Is a default constructor needed?

**[Best practice]** <u>**When in doubt, leave it out.** If the class does not have a "default state", it should not have a default constructor!</u>
- Do not define one arbitrarily or letting it `= default`. This leads to pitfalls.
- Calling the default constructor of something that has no "default state" should result in a **compile error**, instead of being allowed arbitrarily.

---

## Summary

Members of a class

- A class can have data members and member functions.
- Access control: `private`, `public`.
  - One difference between `class` and `struct`: Default access.
- The `this` pointer: has type `X *` (`const X *` in `const` member functions). It points to the object on which the member function is called.
- `const` member function: guarantees that no modification will happen.

---

## Summary

The followings hold for **all constructors**, no matter how they are defined:
- A constructor initializes **all** data members in order in which they are declared.
- The initialization of **all** data members is done before the function body of a constructor is executed.

In a constructor, a member is initialized as follows:
- If there is an initializer for it in the initializer list, use it.
- Otherwise, if it has an in-class initializer, use it.
- Otherwise, it is default-initialized. If it cannot be default-initialized, it leads to a compile-error.

---

## Summary

Default constructors

- The default constructor defines the behavior of default-initialization.
- The default constructor is the constructor with an empty parameter list.
- If we have not defined **any constructor**, the compiler will try to synthesize a **default constructor** as if it were defined as `ClassName() {}`.
  - The compiler may fail to do that if some member has no in-class initializer and is not default-initializable. In that case, the compiler gives up (without giving an error).
- We can use `= default` to ask for a synthesized default constructor explicitly.

---

## Notes

${}^{\textcolor{red}{1}}$ Every *non-`static`* member belongs to an object. All data members mentioned in the slides of this lecture are non-`static`.

${}^{\textcolor{red}{2}}$ A `const` member function cannot modify its data members, unless that member is marked `mutable`.

${}^{\textcolor{red}{3}}$ A constructor does not have a return type according to the standard. But it behaves as if its return type is `void`. Some compilers (such as Clang) may also treat it as if it returns `void`.

${}^{\textcolor{red}{4}}$ In-class initializers cannot be provided in the form `(...)`. The parentheses here will be treated as part of a function declaration.
