Welcome to csrookie's website! This is the personal website of csrookie, dedicating to share info, resource and experience.

I'm currently a student studying computer science in Shanghaitech University(上海科技大学), Junior. I name my github repository 'csrookie' for, literally, I'm still a rookie in the field of cs, and another reason is that I worship Steve Jobs' famous motto 'Stay hungry, stay foolish'. I was a UC Berkeley College of Engineering (COE) visiting student in the semester of Junior. 

My interests lie in multiple aspects in Artificial Intelligence. I've been struggling to discover my truly passionate research direction for two years, but just few months before I ran across one interesting speech delivered by Jensen Huang. He told us that it is rare that you can first have passion in one field and then you dedicate yourself into it. Most of the excellent engineers cultivate their passion and mastery during dedication. Throughout my undergraduate studies, I have explored a diverse range of AI sub-fields—including 2D/3D Computer Vision, NLP, Time Series Analysis, Multi-modal Learning, Generative Models, and even Interpretability—through both rigorous coursework and research projects. This extensive exposure has led me to a realization: every new frontier I encounter sparks a fresh sense of excitement and intellectual curiosity. And so, I made peace with it.

I finished the internship in [4DVLab](https://4dvlab.github.io/index.html) in September, 2024, proudly under the instruction and guidance of [Prof.Yuexin Ma](https://yuexinma.me/aboutme.html) and senior [Yiteng Xu](https://yiteng-xu.github.io/). I finished the short internship in [VRVC](https://vic.shanghaitech.edu.cn/vrvc/en/) in November, 2024, proudly under the guidance of senior [Zhehao Shen](https://moqiyinlun.github.io/). From 2025 Feb, with great honor, I've been working with [Prof.Kewei Tu](https://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/tukw/) and [Prof.Kan Ren](https://sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/rk/list.htm), conducting exploration and research on one challenging frontier project.  

*基于目前的学业排名（**Top 2%**），我已基本锁定2026届推免资格。目前正积极寻求计算机专业**人工智能领域**的课题组，我对该领域内**多个方向均抱有广泛兴趣**，计划攻读**直博或学术型硕士**学位。*
